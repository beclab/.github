*Breadk free from public clouds, build your local AI assistants, sync data across places, self-hosted your workspace, stream your own media, and more——all in a sovereign cloud made possible by Olares.*

Olares is on a mission to let people own their data again.

We believe the current state of the internet, where user data is centralized and exploited by monopolistic corporations, is deeply flawed. Our goal is to empower individuals with true data ownership and control. That's why we build Olares, a free, self-hosted OS that transforms your edge device into sovereign cloud. By securely storing your data and accessing your self-hosted services from anywhere via Olares, you gain complete control over your digital life.

Olares consists of three integral components:

- [**Olares OS**](https://github.com/beclab/olares), an open-source, selfhosted operating system running on personal edge devices, allowing users to host their own data and applications.
- [**Snowinning Protocol**](https://docs.snowinning.com/protocol/overview.html), a decentralized identity and credit system that provides a framework for secure, trustless exchanges of information and value. It integrates with other components of the ecosystem to ensure that transactions and interactions across platforms remain secure and verifiable without centralized oversight.
- [**LarePass**](https://github.com/beclab/larepass), a comprehensive client software solution that operates across multiple platforms. It securely stores users' private keys and manages their identities and data across various devices.
