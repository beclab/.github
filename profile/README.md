*Build your local AI assistants, sync data across places, self-hosted your workspace, stream your own media, and more——all in a sovereign cloud made possible by Olares.*

Olares is on a mission to let people own their data again.

The rise of AI-driven services has increased concerns over data privacy, corporate surveillance, and centralized control. To reverse this trend and enable people to reclaim data sovereignty, we have built Olares, an open-source sovereign cloud OS for local AI. By converting personal hardware into an AI home server, Olares empowers individuals and organizations to run local AI models, manage data, and deploy selfhosted applications locally—on their own infrastructure. 

Olares consists of the following core components:

- [**Olares OS**](https://github.com/beclab/olares), an open-source, selfhosted operating system running on personal edge devices, allowing users to host their own data and applications.
- [**LarePass**](https://www.olares.xyz/larepass), a comprehensive client software solution that operates across multiple platforms. It securely stores users' private keys and manages their identities and data across various devices.
