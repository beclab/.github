Terminus is on a mission to let people own their data again. We believe the current state of the internet, where user data is centralized and exploited by monopolistic corporations, is deeply flawed. Our goal is to empower individuals with true data ownership and control. That's why we build Terminus. 

Built on a Blockchain-Edge-Client (BEC) architecture, Terminus provides a next-generation decentralized Internet framework consisting of the following three integral components:

- [**Terminus OS**](https://github.com/beclab/terminus), a cloud-native operating system designed to run on personal "Edge" devices, allowing users to host their own data and applications.
- [**Snowinning Protocol**](https://docs.jointerminus.com/overview/snowinning/overview.html), a decentralized identity and credit system provides a framework for secure, trustless exchanges of information and value. It integrates with other components of the ecosystem to ensure that transactions and interactions across platforms remain secure and verifiable without centralized oversight.
- [**TermiPass**](https://docs.jointerminus.com/how-to/termipass/overview.html), a comprehensive client software solution that operates across multiple platforms. It securely stores users' private keys and manages their identities and data across various Edge devices.
